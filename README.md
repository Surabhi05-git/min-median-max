exp-6a -min-median-max -In the context of Image Processing and Machine Vision (IPMV), Min-Median-Max refers to a technique used for image filtering and noise reduction. This method involves replacing each pixel value in an image with a new value calculated from the neighboring pixels. Specifically, for each pixel, the minimum, median, and maximum values of the neighboring pixels are calculated. The median value is then used as the new pixel value, effectively reducing the impact of noise and outliers in the image. This technique is particularly useful for removing salt and pepper noise, which can significantly improve the overall quality and clarity of the image. By using the median value, the Min-Median-Max technique helps preserve the edges and details in the image, resulting in a more accurate and visually appealing representation.
